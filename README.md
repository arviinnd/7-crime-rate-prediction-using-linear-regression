Respected everyone, The problem concerns the prediction of crime rate from demographic data using linear regression. First, we read 
the excel file and then split the data into train and test data. Then, we set up the model and fit the data using X_train and Y_train. 
We find the model coefficients and model intercept. We make predictions on crime rate using the test data and find mean squared error 
and variance score of the model. Finally, we plot actual values and predicted values and find Pearson's correlation coefficients for 
the different features. We see that feature X7 has the least influence on the traget variable X1.
